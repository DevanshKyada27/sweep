# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We recently changed our license to the Elastic License V2 to allow Sweep for commercial usage.*<br/>You can self-host Sweep by deploying our Docker image at https://ghcr.io/sweepai/sweep.

## 0. Pre-requisites

You need an OpenAI API key (GPT-4 32k access helps!), and [GitHub developer mode](https://github.com/settings/apps).

You also need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

Pull our image from Docker Hub (it may take 5-10 minutes to download the image):

```sh
docker pull sweepai/sweep:latest
```

## 1. Setting up the GitHub App (5 min)

Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) (3 minutes). You should return here after step 16(it's not as bad as it seems, most steps are optional).

Use the below as a reference:

Set the Repository Permissions (7 selected):
```
| Scope            | Permissions      |
|------------------|------------------|
| actions          | read             |
| checks           | read             |
| contents         | read & write     |
| commit statuses  | read & write     |
| issues           | read & write     |
| metadata         | read             |
| pull requests    | read & write     |
| workflows        | read & write     |
```


```
| Subscribe to events      |
|--------------------------|
| check run                |
| check suite              |
| commit comment           |
| create                   |
| issue comment            |
| issues                   |
| label                    |
| pull request             |
| pull request review      |
| pull request review comment|
| pull request thread      |
| push                     |
| status                   |
| workflow job             |
| workflow run             |
```

Put a placeholder url for now (ex: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/).
Generate a private key (it should prompt you at the top of the screen, or alternatively follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps)) and save it for later. We'll use the key later.

Click Install App to install it on your account or organization. Point it to a repo which you want to use Sweep on. This repo cannot be empty. If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).

## 2. Running the Webhook (5 min)

Now create the following `.env` file with the new secrets:

Pass your PEM through this script in order to get the base64 encoded version of it. You can also use the `base64` command on Linux.
```python
import base64
with open("private-key.pem", "rb") as f:
    print(base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode())
```

```sh
# Replace all newlines here with \n
GITHUB_APP_PEM_BASE64="OUTPUT OF ABOVE SCRIPT"
# 6 digit ID
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-ai

# Should start with "sk-"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Set to true if you have access to 32k model
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
```

If you run into issues, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sweep) or open a GitHub issue (ironic, we know!) at https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues. We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @luke.

Then in the same directory as the `.env`, run:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 sweepai/sweep:latest
```

## 3. Connecting the Webhook to the App (10 min)

{/* <p style={{marginTop: 16, marginBottom: 32}}>
    <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/tree/main">
        <img src="https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue-ghost.svg" alt="Deploy to DO"/>
    </a>
</p>  */}

From here, you can either deploy the webhook locally or in production. For the rest of this guide, we'll assume you're serving locally using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `./ngrok http 8000`. The second last line should say something like

```sh
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8000
```

With the webhook URL, go back to the GitHub Apps settings (`https://github.com/USERNAME/settings/apps/APP_NAME/advanced`) and replace the "Webhook URL" field with https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app(your version). Ensure SSL verification remains active.

## 4. Running Sweep (1 min)

Finally, you can try out Sweep by going to "https://github.com/USERNAME/settings/apps/APP_NAME/installations" to install your repo to the app. You can then try out Sweep by creating a new issue with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: write unit tests for BaseIndex.tsx` and watch the magic happen!

For more details on using Sweep, see our [tutorial](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial) and [advanced usage](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced) guides.

*There's additional configurable settings like Redis caching and GPU-accelerated embeddings that we use for our hosted product that we can document further for self-hosting. If this interests you please contact us at https://discord.gg/sweep.*

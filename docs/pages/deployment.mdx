# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We recently changed our license to the Elastic License V2 to allow Sweep for commercial usage.*<br/>You can self-host Sweep by deploying our Docker image at https://ghcr.io/sweepai/sweep.

## 0. Pre-requisites

You need an OpenAI API key (GPT-4 32k access helps!), and [GitHub developer mode](https://github.com/settings/apps).

You also need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull sweepai/sweep:latest
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

## 1. Setting up the GitHub App (5 min)

### Option a: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Firstly, you need `npm`. If you don't have it, install [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep/self_deploy
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000. Then,
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button.
2. Click the green "Create GitHub App for USERNAME" button.
3. Pick where to install the app and then click the green "Install" button. This will take you to the app settings page.
4. Click the small "App settings" button.

Now run `cat sweep/self_deploy/.env` to get a file containing your PEM, named `PRIVATE_KEY` in this file and your app ID, named `APP_ID`. You will need these for step 2.

If you've made it this far, you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, you may have to set it up manually.

### Option b: Manual Setup (15 min)
Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) (3 minutes). You should return here after step 16(it's not as bad as it seems, most steps are optional).

Use the below as a reference:

Set the Repository Permissions (7 selected):

| Scope            | Permissions      |
|------------------|------------------|
| actions          | read             |

| push                     |
| status                   |
| workflow job             |
| workflow run             |

Put a placeholder url for now (ex: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/).
Generate a private key (it should prompt you at the top of the screen, or alternatively follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps)) and save it for later. This is your `private-key.pem` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/pem.png)

You will also need your app ID, which is the number at the top of the page. This is your `app-id` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/appid.png)

Click Install App to install it on your account or organization. Point it to a repo which you want to use Sweep on. This repo cannot be empty. If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).

## 2. Serving the Webhook (5 min)

*Starting here it gets more involved so if you run into issues, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sweep) or open a GitHub issue (ironic, we know!) at https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues. We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @luke.*

From here, you can either serve the webhook on a server or locally. But first, we need to prepare a few environment variables.

```sh
# The private key from Step 1
# This should be a single line, replace all newlines with "\n"
GITHUB_APP_PEM=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxxxxxxx...xxxxxxxx==\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# 6 digit ID
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
# Should start with "sk-"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

### Optional Additional Configs ###

# Set to true if you have access to 32k model
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
# Set to bigger model like sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 for better but slower search
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

### Option a: Serving on a DigitalOcean (Recommended)

You can deploy Sweep on DigitalOcean:

1. First click the following link (requires sign in):

<p style={{marginTop: 16, marginBottom: 32}}>
    <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/tree/main">
        <img src="https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue-ghost.svg" alt="Deploy to DO"/>
    </a>
</p>

2. Click next and then click edit on the "Environment Variables" section. Fill in the environment variables from above.
3. Click next again. Then click edit on the plan and change to an instance with at least 2 GB of RAM, otherwise you will run out of memory.
4. Finally click create resource. This will take a few minutes to deploy.

Finally, it should say deployed and you should get a link like https://sweep-6fvkz.ondigitalocean.app/ at the top.

### Option b: Serving locally (10 min)

First, create a `.env` file with the contents above. Then in the same directory, run:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 sweepai/sweep:latest
```

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `./ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

## 3. Using Sweep (1 min)

With the webhook URL, first validate things are working by going to the link, it should say "Sweep is up and running!". Then, go back to the GitHub Apps settings (`https://github.com/USERNAME/settings/apps/APP_NAME/advanced`) and replace the "Webhook URL" field with https://sweep-6fvkz.ondigitalocean.app/ (your version). Ensure SSL verification remains active.

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: write unit tests for BaseIndex.tsx` and watch the magic happen!

For more details on using Sweep, see our [tutorial](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial) and [advanced usage](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced) guides.

*There's additional configurable settings like Redis caching and GPU-accelerated embeddings that we use for our hosted product that we can document further for self-hosting. If this interests you please contact us at https://discord.gg/sweep.*
